      <p>There are four seasons. Check out the table below to see what each of the seasons are and when they occur:</p>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Season</th>
          <th>Occurrence</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Spring</td>
          <td>From March 1 to May 31</td>
          <td>Temp gets a bit warmer and flowers bloom</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Summer</td>
          <td>From June 1 to August 31</td>
          <td>Hotter months and the days are longer</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fall</td>
          <td>From Sept 1 to Nov 30</td>
          <td>Temp cools down and deciduous trees began to shed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Winter</td>
          <td>From Dec 1 to Feb 28</td>
          <td>Colder months and we get snow in some parts</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Below is another way of seeing the similarities and differences of the seasons:</p>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Temperature</th>
          <th>Season</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td rowspan="2">Cool</td>
          <td>Fall</td>
          <td>Temp cools down and deciduous trees began to shed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Winter</td>
          <td>Colder months and we get snow in some parts</td>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Warm</td>
            <td>Summer</td>
            <td>Hotter months and the days are longer</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Spring</td>
            <td>Temp gets a bit warmer and flowers bloom</td>
          </tr>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Lastly here is a table of the types of things you can do (in my opinion) depending of the season:</p>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Season</th>
          <th>Good for swimming outdoors?</th>
          <th>Good for hiking?</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Spring</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Summer</td>
          <center><td colspan="2">Yes</td></center>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fall</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Winter</td>
          <td colspan="2">No</td>
        </tr>
    </body>
