How to Tackle jQuery 
1) Research the following on JQuery 
- History 
- Purpose 
- Past and current uses 

2) Look at jQuery code 
- Watch some tutorials on how its written 
- See in what cases its being used 

What worked?
Googled jQuery and was able to find one link that offered background history and the purpose of jQuery. Its also listed out the languages you needed to know ahead of using jQuery. What was also helpful were the code snippets that showed you jQuery syntax as it relates to HTML elements. What also helped was watching tutorials of these functions being used. 

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()
A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

Examples:
$(this).hide() - hides the current element.
$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.
$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".
$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".
