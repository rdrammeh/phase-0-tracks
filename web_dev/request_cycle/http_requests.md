What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
A GET request, requests data from a specified resource, whereas a POST request sends data to be processed to a specified resource. A GET request might be used to get nonsensitive information that can be referred to again by bookmarking. You might use a POST request to send sensitive information such as passwords.

Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
An HTTP cookie is used for client-side storage. It sends bits of data from a server to a client's computer. This data can be stored and sent back to the server. Its normally used to tell whether two requests came from the same client.
