# Git Definitions

**Instructions:** Define each of the follow Git concepts.

*Whats is version control? Why is it useful?
#Version control is a feature that allows a user to see the entire history of any changes that occur within files in a repository. This is useful because if there are bugs in our code we can see all of the changes we've made up until that point. That will allow us to track down the lines of code that may be causing those issues. 

*What is a branch and why would you use one?
#A branch is a separate folder that we create within a repository, that can add features to our project. We use branches so that we aren't making changes directly to our master code. This in turns, allows us to make as many feature without disturbing the foundation of our code and interchange the features whenever we want. 

*What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
#A commit is a save point that a developer does when they've made changes to a file within a repository. A good commit message is one that is clear and descriptive about the changes that were made. 

*What is a merge conflict?
#A merge conflict is an error that occurs when you're trying to merge or download a local branch with the master file.
