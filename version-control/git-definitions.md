# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
#version control is a feature that allows a user to see the entire history of any changes that occur within files in a repo. This is useful because if there are bugs in our code we can see all the changes we've made in our change to track down what may be causing issues. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
#A branch is a separate folder that we create within a repo to add on features to our project. We use branches so that we aren't making changes directly to our master code, which in turns allows us to make as many features without disturbing the foundation of our code. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
# A commit is a save point that a developer does when they're made changes files within a repo. A good commit message is one that is clear and descriptive about what changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?
# A merge conflict is an error that occurs when you're trying to merge or download a local branch with the master file.
